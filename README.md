# GSD-WUR

GSD-WUR is a MATLAB-based app that allows for the analysis of nonlinear stresses generated by dilatational deformations. This respository contains the files required to install and use the app, for installation first install MATLAB and then open the .mlappinstall. 

For detailed instructions on how to use the app, see the manual. 

For more information on the analysis, see:

"A. de Groot, J. Yang, L.M.C. Sagis, Surface stress decomposition in large amplitude oscillatory interfacial dilatation of complex interfaces, JCIS, 569-581, 2023, doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2023.02.007"

For users without access to Matlab we included a standalone version in the corresponding folder.
